        When you officially register your company, the first company directors
        are appointed at the same time. Each new director will be asked to
        provide their full name, address, date of birth, nationality, country of
        residence, former names and business occupation. This is standard
        information to be included in the relevant form which the director will
        be required to sign to signify consent to act as a director.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are statutory duties that directors need to perform in their
        capacity as company directors. Ultimately, the directors are responsible
        for ensuring that the company complies with statutory controls they have
        to comply with in the eyes of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide professional customer support to all clients before, during
        and after the registration of your company. We can assist you at any
        point, and our friendly team are here to offer you the support you need.
